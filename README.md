These are the files for my spigot server, the rest either need to be downloaded or are created when the jar file is run.
the bot token might need to be added in the /plugins/DiscordSRV/config.yml
There are no world files, so the plugins need to be copied to the world once generated
The server jar file can be downloaded using wget from the spigot site, for example `wget https://download.getbukkit.org/spigot/spigot-1.20.1.jar` then rename it to server.jar so the .bat or .sh will launch it
